# DisposAI - AI-Powered Medicine Disposal Guide

An intelligent application that helps users safely dispose of medications using AI-powered identification and guidance.

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID

## 🚀 AI-Powered Features

This application uses **OpenAI GPT** and **Tesseract.js OCR** to provide:

- **Real-time OCR**: Extracts text from medicine package images
- **AI Medicine Identification**: GPT identifies medicines from detected text
- **Intelligent Disposal Guidance**: AI-generated disposal methods, warnings, and environmental impact data
- **Location-Based Pharmacy Finder**: GPT-powered search for nearby take-back locations
- **Dynamic Information**: All medicine data is generated by AI, not hardcoded

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```sh
# .env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Get your API key:**
1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy it to your `.env` file

**Important:** The API key must start with `VITE_` prefix to be accessible in Vite applications.

### 3. Start Development Server

```sh
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Before (Hardcoded):
- ❌ Hardcoded medicine database with only ~10 medicines
- ❌ Simulated OCR (fake text detection)
- ❌ Simple string matching for medicine identification
- ❌ Hardcoded disposal methods and environmental data
- ❌ Static pharmacy locations

### After (AI-Powered):
- ✅ Real OCR using Tesseract.js
- ✅ GPT-powered medicine identification from any detected text
- ✅ AI-generated disposal methods, warnings, and environmental impact
- ✅ Dynamic pharmacy location search using GPT
- ✅ Works with any medicine, not just pre-defined ones

## 📁 Key Files

- `src/services/openai.ts` - OpenAI GPT integration
- `src/services/ocr.ts` - Tesseract.js OCR service
- `src/components/ImageScanner.tsx` - Updated to use real OCR + GPT
- `src/components/DisposalReport.tsx` - Updated to use GPT for pharmacy locations

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **API Costs**: Using GPT will incur OpenAI API costs. Monitor usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of OpenAI rate limits for production use
3. **Error Handling**: The app gracefully falls back to default responses if API calls fail
4. **Privacy**: Images are processed locally (OCR) and only text is sent to OpenAI API
